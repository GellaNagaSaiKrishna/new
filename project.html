      Since the day we have seen that unbelievably gorgeous Pangong Tso Lake in the Bollywood hit ‘3 Idiots’, we have been waiting for the day we’d get to visit it. Though it’s true that the lake is as mesmerising as it appeared onscreen, the bitter part is that ‘waiting’ isn’t going to get you there. Getting up to your computer and booking a trip to Ladakh on the other hand just might! So, rope in a few good friends who don’t mind a little chilly weather and get going to one of the best places to visit with friends.

        Things To Do In Ladakh: Scooty ride near Pangong, ATV ride and camel safari in Nubra, river rafting in Zanskar, and more.
        Places To Stay: Pangong Hermitage Resort, Pangong Paradise
        Average Budget: INR 8,000
