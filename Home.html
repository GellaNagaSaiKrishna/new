        Inter-city transport in India is not perfect but it will definitely get you where you need to be. There are options of train, bus, plane and occasionally boats to travel within the country. The Indian travel options are exciting with a chance to experience narrow-gauge railways, the Ambassador car, steam engines, and Bullet motorbikes.

Here's a breakup of all commuting options in India:

Auto Rickshaws: Widely available in almost every city and town, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai.
Cycle Rickshaws: Common in places like Delhi (especially Chandni Chowk), Jaipur, and Varanasi.
Airplane: For intercity/state travel, there are several flight plying to and fro from cities. Currently, India has around 104 domestic airports across the country. 
Local Trains: Mumbai's local train system, Kolkata's suburban railway, and Chennai's local train network.
Metro Trains: Delhi Metro, Bangalore Metro, Kolkata Metro, and Hyderabad Metro.
Buses: Available across the country.
Taxis: Available in major cities.
Boats/Ferries: Ferries in Kerala backwaters, boats in Varanasi on the Ganges, and Sundarbans delta cruises in West Bengal.
Trams: Kolkata is the most notable, with its colonial-era tram system.

Air India, Jet Airways and Vistara are the traditional airline options.

      <h2>Getting Around India By Rail</h2>
      <h3>
        Travelling by train is one of India's classic experiences. Almost all the parts of the country are connected by the national railways. You can save time by travelling in an overnight train. There are three basic types of trains in India - inter-city trains for long distance, superfast trains (Shatabdi, Rajdhani, Duronto) connecting major cities and slow passenger trains which tend to stop everywhere. Trains tend to run late oftentimes, and you should account for that while planning your onward journey.

        Getting Around India By Road
      </h2>
      <h3>
        It is advisable for tourists to hire cabs/ATV/jeeps in hilly areas in India instead of self-driven cars since driving in these regions can be rather challenging. However, self driven cars and car rental firms are widely common in all parts of the country with a huge supply of vehicles with drivers. All the cities and places in India are connected by roads and can be travelled by car. However, be sure to check the road conditions on the route you plan to take.

        Getting Around India By Water
      </h2>
      <h3>Very few boat services operate in India. The Andaman Islands are connected to Kolkata and Chennai. Kerala has a regular passenger service from Allapuzha and Kollam. The Sunderbans in the delta region are only accessible by boat.</h3>
